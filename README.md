# Registry

Create microservices, service discovery with Eureka and docker containers to test the registry capabilities between Eureka and docker.

Customer is a microservice with capabilities to get and create (post) customer, it is very simply just to create many instants and
register those on Eureka, also put it on a container and deploy it many times to check docker registry.
